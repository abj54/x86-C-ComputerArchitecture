After writing my code, I had a bunch of errors that I kept getting which I 
debugged using various printf statements. Similarly I also got errors 
when I didnot kick start the Transimtter Interrupt everytime. To test it,
I used various conditions that included different statements of different 
lengths. Similarly, I also checked how my buffer would react in different
situations by printing it in various cases.
